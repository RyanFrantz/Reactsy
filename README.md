# Reactsy

Reactsy is an Android-based psychomotor vigiliance test (PVT) app. I
effectively commissioned this work from my coworker Michael Horowitz. My goal
is to further research into the effect of sleep loss on knowledge workers like
Web Operations or Software Development engineers.

See [https://codeascraft.com/2013/09/28/nagios-sleep-data-and-you/](https://codeascraft.com/2013/09/28/nagios-sleep-data-and-you/)
for more information on some of that research.
